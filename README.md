# 🕹️ Rock Paper Scissors – Web & Terminal Game

This project is a **Rock Paper Scissors game** implemented in both **terminal** and **web (browser)** formats using Python.  
The goal of this project was to understand **core programming logic** and then apply it to a **real web application using Flask**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The game allows users to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.  
In the web version, the user interacts through buttons, and the game dynamically updates the result and score without restarting the app.

The project also includes a terminal-based version to demonstrate how the **same logic** can work across different interfaces.
